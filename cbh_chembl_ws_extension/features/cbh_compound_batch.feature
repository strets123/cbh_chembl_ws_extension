Feature: CBH Compound Batch
    In order to keep track of compounds I would like to create 
    a batch of a new compound in the project I am an admin of.
    As a project stakeholder I do not want batches to be logged in 
    projects that the user does not have editor access to

    Scenario Outline: Batches project privileges saving and validating
        Given a User
        and my user is member of a group
        and I have a valid molfile
        and a valid project exists proja
        and I automatically have editor permissions as creator
        and I remove my permissions
        and I have<editor> given <me_or_group> editor privileges for proja
        and I have<viewer> given <me_or_group> viewer privileges for proja        
        When <dologin> log in
        Then I <action> my cbh_compound_batch to proja and the <responsecode>

    Scenario: User submits a substance to project they have editor rights to, but the substance is already preregistered to other private and public projects they do not have editor rights to.  
        Given a User
        and I have a valid molfile
        and a valid project exists proja
        and a valid project exists projb
        and a valid project exists projc
        and a valid project exists projd
        and this substance is not pre-registered to proja

        and I have editor rights for proja
        and I have viewer rights for projb

        and I have no rights for projd
        When I log in 
        and I validate a cbh_compound_batch to proja        
        Then the response will contain an id for a previously registered substance in projb
        and the response will contain an id for a previously registered substance in projd
        and the response will not contain an id for a previously registered substance in projc


    Scenario: User submits retrieved ID of substance to make a batch, but is not entitled to this substance.
        Given a User
        When I log in 
        and I have a valid molfile
        and a valid project exists proja

        and I have viewer rights for projb

        and I have no rights for projd
        When I validate a cbh_compound_batch to proja

        and the response will contain an id for a previously registered substance in projd

        Then the response for projb registered ID will be <responsecode>
        and the response for projd registered ID will be <responsecode>
       

    



    Scenario: User registers a batch with a substance ID that does not exist 
        Given a User

        and I have a substance ID <false_ID> that does not exist
        When I create batch with <false_ID>       
        Then the response will be <error_substance_ID_not_found>




    Scenario: User registers a batch with a substance ID that is not valid 
        Given a User
        When I log in 
        and I have a substance ID <invalid_ID> that is not valid
